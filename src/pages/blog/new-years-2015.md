The team at Ninjality wishes you all a happy new year! 2014 was a great year for us, and we'd like for the new year to be even better by releasing a refresh to the site's design; we changed the logo  in the header, created new icons for the services, and overall improved our homepage to make it look more appealing. The blog should be better to read as well. On top of that, you should notice some of the content changes thanks to our recent work on [Pimp My Setup](/portfolio/web/).

To get you guys up-to-speed on what will be going on this year, we're happy to talk about the current development of [Hylus](http://hylus.com/). The current site is stagnant, but we've decided sometime last year that a complete restart was needed on the project. A fresh codebase, modern design, and overall better user experience are what we're aiming for with the new Hylus. It's too early for sneak peeks, but an early release should be ready by quarter 1 or quarter 2 of this year.

As far as our blog and [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/NinjalityDesign) goes, we'll be posting more tutorials and even coding-related videos/screencasts, so [subscribe](http://www.youtube.com/NinjalityDesign?sub_confirmation=1) if you want to be notified of that.

That's all for now. If you have any suggestions you can let us know with a comment.
