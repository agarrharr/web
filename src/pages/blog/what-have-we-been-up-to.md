So you really haven't heard from us in a while so I just wanted to let you know what we have been up to!

We have recently started work on the Digital Bounds redesign and we are very excited to share that with you when we complete it! It is going to feature a fully redesigned, responsive website that I'm sure you will love! We will be writing a full article about the redesign itself.
	
You may have also noticed that Hylus has been down the last week or so. No, this is not on purpose. We have tried fixing it but have kept coming up empty. When we get some time to really focus on this we will be sure to let you know when it's back up! On top of the Hylus issues we also experienced some server outage the last couple days but  have no fear, Digital Ocean is here and they fixed the problem as soon as it happened!

As for YouTube, I can personally attest that I have been slacking in this area, with the company itself keeping me pretty busy I haven't had much time to focus on Speed Art videos. But don't get upset, I will definitely be pushing one out in the next few days!

Overall, we have been really busy and we are definitely excited to be this busy and moving the company in a whole new direction. With that direction we also plan on releasing a "Labs" portion of Ninjality, which we will reveal more details when we get closer to release. But don't worry! We haven't fell off just yet! We just can't wait to see what everyone thinks of the work we have been doing!
